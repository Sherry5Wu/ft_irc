Logic:

1. start up the server, start listening;
2. client sents data to server;
3. Server :
   * parses the data;
   * execute the it if it is valid;
   * sents the response



What different classes do?

Server:
    1. setup listening socket;
    2. listeing/mointer new connections, new data requests;
    3. pass the raw data to Message to store and parse.
    4. commands;
    5. send the responese to the client if needed


Client:
    1. Saving user info :nickname, username, password , (maybe)the channels that
       the user joined??
    2. ......


Channel:
    1. Channel relatived infos;
    2. Channel commands?


Message:
    1. sotre the raw data;
    2. Parse the message, separate each command line

For testing:

> nc -C 127.0.0.1 8080

This opens a TCP connection to 127.0.0.1 on port 8080
The -C flag: Send CRLF (\r\n) as line endings instead of just \n.


Sherry:
    execute function in Message classes
    removeUser Logic
    disconnect server??
