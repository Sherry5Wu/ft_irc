Channels:

    Channels names are strings (beginning with a '&' or '#' character) of
   length up to 200 characters.  Apart from the the requirement that the
   first character being either '&' or '#'; the only restriction on a
   channel name is that it may not contain any spaces (' '), a control G
   (^G or ASCII 7), or a comma (',' which is used as a list item
   separator by the protocol).

   There are two types of channels: distruibuted channel, which names start with '&'.

    The commands which may only be used by channel operators are:

        KICK    - Eject a client from the channel
        MODE    - Change the channel's mode
        INVITE  - Invite a client to an invite-only channel (mode +i)
        TOPIC   - Change the channel topic in a mode +t channel

    A channel operator is identified by the '@' symbol next to their
    nickname whenever it is associated with a channel (ie replies to the
    NAMES, WHO and WHOIS commands).


2. The IRC Specification

2.2 character codes
    {}  --> []
    |  -->  \

2.3 Messages

    Each IRC message may consist of up to three main parts: the prefix
   (optional), the command, and the command parameters (of which there
   may be up to 15).
   The presence of a prefix is indicated with a single leading ASCII
   colon character (':', 0x3b), which must be the first character of the
   message itself.  There must be no gap (whitespace) between the colon
   and the prefix.  The prefix is used by servers to indicate the true
   origin of the message.

    If the prefix is missing from the message, it
   is assumed to have originated from the connection from which it was
   received.  Clients should not use prefix when sending a message from
   themselves; if they use a prefix, the only valid prefix is the
   registered nickname associated with the client.  If the source
   identified by the prefix cannot be found from the server's internal
   database, or if the source is registered from a different link than
   from which the message arrived, the server must ignore the message
   silently.

   The command must either be a valid IRC command or a three (3) digit
   number represented in ASCII text.

    IRC messages are always lines of characters terminated with a CR-LF
   (Carriage Return - Line Feed) pair, and these messages shall not
   exceed 512 characters in length, counting all characters including
   the trailing CR-LF. Thus, there are 510 characters maximum allowed
   for the command and its parameters.

2.3.1 Message format in 'pseudo' BNF

    The extracted message is parsed into the components <prefix>,
   <command> and list of parameters matched either by <middle> or
   <trailing> components.

   The BNF representation for this is:


    <message>  ::= [':' <prefix> <SPACE> ] <command> <params> <crlf>
    <prefix>   ::= <servername> | <nick> [ '!' <user> ] [ '@' <host> ]
    <command>  ::= <letter> { <letter> } | <number> <number> <number>
    <SPACE>    ::= ' ' { ' ' }
    <params>   ::= <SPACE> [ ':' <trailing> | <middle> <params> ]

    <middle>   ::= <Any *non-empty* sequence of octets not including SPACE
                or NUL or CR or LF, the first of which may not be ':'>
    <trailing> ::= <Any, possibly *empty*, sequence of octets not including
                    NUL or CR or LF>

    <crlf>     ::= CR LF

NOTES:
  4)    The NUL character is not special in message framing, and
        basically could end up inside a parameter, but as it would
        cause extra complexities in normal C string handling. Therefore
        NUL is not allowed within messages.
  6)    Use of the extended prefix (['!' <user> ] ['@' <host> ]) must
        not be used in server to server communications and is only
        intended for server to client messages in order to provide
        clients with more useful information about who a message is
        from without the need for additional queries.
